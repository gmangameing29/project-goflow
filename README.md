# 🌾 GrowFlow – Solving World Hunger with AI, Drones, and a Dog Named Chatdoggo 🐶

Welcome to GrowFlow, the future of food systems. We’re using **Python, sensors, AI, and drone tech** to build an intelligent system that grows food smarter, tracks it better, and gets it to the people who need it most. Powered by **Chatdoggo**, the world’s first hunger-fighting digital pup. 🐾

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- **SmartFarm**: Uses simulated soil moisture, light levels, and AI logic to grow crops efficiently.
- **FoodBankNetwork**: Tracks food surpluses and shortages, and redistributes where needed.
- **Chatdoggo AI**: Fetches hunger stats, deploys drone missions, and keeps the good vibes going.
- **Scalable Vision**: This is just the start—add sensors, real drone APIs, or connect to real-time NGO networks.
