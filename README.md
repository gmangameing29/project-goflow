# 🌾 project-goflow – Solving World Hunger with AI, Drones, and a Dog Named Chatdoggo 🐶

Welcome to project-goflow, the future of food systems. We’re using **Python, sensors, AI, and drone tech** to build an intelligent system that grows food smarter, tracks it better, and gets it to the people who need it most. Powered by **Chatdoggo**, the world’s first hunger-fighting digital pup. 🐾

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- **SmartFarm**: Uses simulated soil moisture, light levels, and AI logic to grow crops efficiently.
- **FoodBankNetwork**: Tracks food surpluses and shortages, and redistributes where needed.
- **Chatdoggo AI**: Fetches hunger stats, deploys drone missions, and keeps the good vibes going.
- **Scalable Vision**: This is just the start—add sensors, real drone APIs, or connect to real-time NGO networks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone this repo and run the main system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmangameing29/project-goflow.git
cd project-goflow
python growflow.py
```

You'll see:
- Smart farm status updates
- Food supply redistribution
- Chatdoggo deploying food drones ✈️

---

## 🛠 Future Plans

- 🔗 Connect to real-time hunger data APIs (UN, WHO)
- 🛰️ Use real drones via delivery SDKs (Zipline, DJI)
- 🌍 Global dashboard with live food status
- 🏫 Run this as a school club or coding challenge
